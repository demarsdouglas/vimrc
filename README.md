## This is my vimrc lol

This is where I keep my vimrc so I can get it into new environments quickly.

I keep it very lightweight because this allows it to be picked up by Vim plugins in proper IDEs without a fuss. Infact, the only thing I really care about is `inoremap jk <ESC>`, the rest are just handy incase you need to quickly edit a file in the terminal.
